# bls_spain_visa_scripts
In this repository, I will upload all my scripts that I use to book a consulate appointment.

# Why did I create this script in the first place?
- It's really hard to get an appointment at a consulate these days, if you don't use script or automatic script.
- Because Appointments are only available for a few minutes and usually disappear for weeks.
- You will never get an appointment if you don't use script.
- so I hope someone can benefit from my scripts ;).
# how to use it?
1. Install Tampermonkey chrome extension.
2. Select a script in this repo that you wish to use. ...
3. Copy the source.
4. Open Tampermonkey in your browser and click the Add Script tab (icon with a plus symbol)
5. Paste the source into the script window and hit save.
6. Voila! ;)
