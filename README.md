bls_spain_visa_scripts
In this repository, I will upload all my scripts that I use to book a consulate appointment.

Why did I create this script in the first place?It's really hard to get an appointment at a consulate these days, if you don't use script or automatic script.
Because Appointments are only available for a few minutes and usually disappear for weeks.
You will never get an appointment if you don't use script.
so I hope someone can benefit from my scripts ;).
how to use it?Install Tampermonkey chrome extension.
Select a script in this repo that you wish to use. ...
Copy the source.
Open Tampermonkey in your browser and click the Add Script tab (icon with a plus symbol)
Paste the source into the script window and hit save.
Voila! ;)
